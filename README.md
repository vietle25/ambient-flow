- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction
- **Service Layer**: Business logic separation
- **Auto Route**: Type-safe navigation

### Key Components

- `BookmarkCubit`: Manages bookmark state and operations
- `BookmarkStorageService`: Handles bookmark persistence
- `AudioCoordinatorService`: Coordinates audio operations
- `BookmarkCollection`: Manages collections of bookmarks
- `SoundBookmark`: Represents saved sound combinations
